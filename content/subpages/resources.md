![screen reader text](laboratory.jpg "")

In this section of our website you will be able to access a variety of resources designed by the associated researchers and/or assistants of the FONDECYT 1220560 project. Most of the resources are aimed at being guides for putting network analysis into practice. Additionally, we hope to publish the products developed within the framework of the project: publications and analysis codes.

At the moment the resources available are the following:

- [Introduction to network analysis with R](https://github.com/anespinosa/cts-chile)
- [Workshops Exponential Random Graph Models (RLARS 2021)](https://www.google.com](https://github.com/anespinosa/ergms-rlars-2021)
